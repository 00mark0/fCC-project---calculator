If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign).
    
**Note:** The sequence "5 * - 5" should produce an output of "-25", but it currently produces '0'. There is a toggle sign button that can be used to calculate negative numbers correctly. Press the toggle sign button after entering a number you want to be negative to ensure accurate calculations.
